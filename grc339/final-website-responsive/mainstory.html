                            <h2>How to Find a Variegated Monstera</h2>
                    
                                <p>This incredible plant is called a Variegated Monstera. What makes this plant so special is that it shows two different colors on the same leaf. This is caused by a special genetic mutation, it shows two different chromosomal make-ups in a single plant, where some tissue is able to produce chlorophyll and other is not</p>

                                <p>Every plant lover will know how hard it is to find the Variegated Monstera. Local stores will not carry such a rare breed, ordering online or through verified plant stores on Instagram are both great ways. If you are able to travel, book a plan ticket to Portland Oregon. Many Portland Oregon plant shops have had these come in and out of their shops. These popular shops are a must visit:  Gurton’s Plant Shop, Solabee Flowers & Botanicals, Arium Botanicals, Pistils Nursury and Marbott’s Greenhouse & Nursery. Portland Oregon is basically the plant hub shopping in the West Coast.   </p>

                                <p>Why is this plant so popular? The reason is because it ties in with any home interior decoration. It brings together the living room and creates a peaceful ambiance. Pets such as dogs and cats are not allergic to this plant which makes it even better for household decoration. The Monstera requires minimal water and sunlight which makes it very easy to take care of them. The only disadvantage is that when it grows too big, the plant needs to be grown outside once it gets too large. This plant also takes on different forms with its leaves almost completely white. This plant is very special in its own ways.</p>
